🐍 Python Mini Challenges Repository
Overview
This repository is a personal collection of Python mini-challenges I’ve completed to strengthen my programming fundamentals and problem-solving skills. Each challenge focuses on practicing core Python concepts through hands-on coding rather than passive learning.
The goal of this repository is consistent practice, experimentation, and gradual mastery of Python.

📁 Repository Structure
Each folder represents a single mini-challenge
Every folder contains:
- A Python script with my solution
- A README.md file that:
- Explains the challenge
- Describes the problem requirements
- Walks through how my code solves the problem

🧠 Topics Practiced
These challenges help reinforce foundational Python concepts such as:
- Variables and data types
- Lists and dictionaries
- Loops and conditionals
- Functions
- User input and output
- Basic logic and problem decomposition
- More advanced concepts may be added as my learning progresses.

🎯 Purpose
This repository exists to:
- Practice Python consistently
- Build confidence through small, achievable challenges
- Track learning progress over time
- Create a reference for common patterns and logic
- It also serves as a public learning log that reflects growth rather than perfection.

🚀 Future Plans
- Add more challenges with increasing difficulty
- Refactor older solutions as skills improve
- Expand into topics like file handling, APIs, and data analysis
